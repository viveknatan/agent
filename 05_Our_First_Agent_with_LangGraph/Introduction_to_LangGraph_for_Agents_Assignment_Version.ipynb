        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as a search engine or a neural retriever, which identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from these documents is incorporated into the input to provide additional context and knowledge that can be used by the generative model.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The additional context from the retrieved documents helps the model produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in question answering systems, chatbots, and other applications requiring detailed and accurate information retrieval and generation.\""

However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/rambodazimi/KD-LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale. Without introducing new experiments, we aim to improve the\\nunderstanding and application of LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-18\\nTitle: LoRA-drop: Efficient LoRA Parameter Pruning based on Output Evaluation\\nAuthors: Hongyun Zhou, Xiangyu Lu, Wang Xu, Conghui Zhu, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun Yang\\nSummary: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is currently the most commonly used\\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, it introduces auxiliary\\nparameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited\\ncomputing resources. However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\", name='arxiv', id='55d007f8-54dd-4840-9a58-ba0e61d06f78', tool_call_id='call_7GzJ36E7AqUM6yfbvuNwMVRA'), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://ai2050.schmidtsciences.org/fellow/tim-dettmers/\", \"content\": \"Tim Dettmers is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a Research Scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and his research focuses on making\"}, {\"url\": \"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/tdettmers/\", \"content\": \"Tim Dettmers is a masters student in informatics at the University of Lugano where he works on deep learning research.

This survey\\nprovides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the\\nliterature. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a\\nframework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various\\nmeasures for evaluating attention models are reviewed, and methods to\\ncharacterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework\\nare discussed. Last, future work in the field of attention models is\\nconsidered.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-07-04\\nTitle: Attention mechanisms for physiological signal deep learning: which attention should we take?\\nAuthors: Seong-A Park, Hyung-Chul Lee, Chul-Woo Jung, Hyun-Lim Yang\\nSummary: Attention mechanisms are widely used to dramatically improve deep learning\\nmodel performance in various fields. However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='2863b656-2d34-41fb-84dc-5536599b62c5', tool_call_id='call_1opyXvimXN6yz5z9EFtlUgCG')]\n",

This can include phrasing a query, specifying a style, choice of words and grammar, providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic. It is a technique used to refine large language models (LLMs) with specific or recommended prompts to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.

            "The history of prompt engineering is closely tied to the development and evolution of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It can be traced back to the early days of AI research when data scientists were testing various ways of interacting with AI models. The need for structured guidance in AI models became apparent as early large language models (LLMs) struggled to consistently understand or follow instructions. This led to the development of prompt engineering as a means to improve AI model outputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "A significant breakthrough came with the release of GPT-3 in 2020, which demonstrated the potential of prompt engineering to 'trick' AI models into performing desired tasks. The introduction of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) further enhanced the ability of AI models to follow instructions and align with human intent. Since then, prompt engineering has rapidly evolved into its own discipline, with advanced techniques like multimodal prompting emerging in recent years.

            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technology that combines retrieval techniques with generative models to enhance the capabilities of AI systems, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. It was first proposed in 2020 by Patrick Lewis and a team at Facebook AI Research, as detailed in their paper \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.\" This concept has since been embraced by both academic and industry researchers as a way to significantly improve the value of generative AI systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "RAG gained further attention in March 2023 during the NVIDIA GTC conference, where it was highlighted for its use of vector databases. This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to access private data, serving as an auxiliary memory and knowledge base. The rise of RAG in 2023 sparked discussions about its effectiveness compared to fine-tuned LLMs, with RAG being recognized for its real-time efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n",
            "\n",
            "The evolution of RAG systems has been marked by advancements in retrieval techniques and generative models, including the integration of transformer-based architectures. This has led to the development of more sophisticated AI systems capable of accessing and leveraging a broader range of external knowledge, establishing a new paradigm for creating more informative and accurate AI systems.\n",

            "Fine-tuning in machine learning is a process where a pre-trained model is adapted for specific tasks or use cases. It is a subset of transfer learning, leveraging the knowledge an existing model has already learned as a starting point for learning new tasks. Fine-tuning is particularly important in the development of large language models (LLMs), allowing them to be adapted for various applications, such as chatbots or coding.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of fine-tuning has been around for some time, but it gained significant attention with the rise of deep learning and the development of large pre-trained models. The process typically involves training the parameters of a pre-trained neural network model on new data, which can be done on the entire network or just a subset of its layers. This technique is often used in supervised learning but can also be applied using weak supervision or reinforcement learning from human feedback.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became more prominent with the development of models like ChatGPT, which is a fine-tuned version of the GPT models. The technique has been crucial in adapting models pre-trained on large, general corpora for specific tasks by reusing their parameters and adding task-specific layers.\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of historical context, fine-tuning has been a part of machine learning practices for several years, but its importance and application have grown with advancements in AI and the increasing complexity of models. The exact timeline of when fine-tuning \"broke onto the scene\" is not precisely defined, but it has been a key component of machine learning strategies, especially with the advent of deep learning and large-scale models.\n",
